**Getting Started**

**Note:** Detailed instructions are located in the tutorial and in the initial assignment.<br>
**A.** Accept the assignment invitation on D2L.<br>
**B.** Clone the assignment to your computer.<br>
**C.** Go to File > Project Structure. Under Project Settings, click on Project and verify that 
the Project SDK is set to JDK 11 or higher.  If it is not, select the correct SDK from the drop-down.<br>

**E.** Create the main/java directory in the src directory. This is where you will be creating your 
Java classes for your assignment.<br>

**Submitting your assignment**

**A.** Once you have completed all the problems, commit your final code to GitHub. <br>
- Please also commit code after each step of each problem and remember to run the unit tests 
(where applicable) and code analyzers before you commit.<br>

**B.** Then in IntelliJ, go to File, select Export to Zip File. This will a create a zip file of the 
entire project directory.<br>
**C.** Submit the .zip file to the Homework X Assignment folder on D2L.<br>

**Problem 1**

**A.** In the main/java directory, create a class named `Calculator`.
- Create a static method named `addNums` that takes two integer parameters and returns their sum.
    - Uncomment the blah blah test cases in the test/java directory to test this method. Run the code 
    analyzers and commit your code now.
- Create a static method named `subtractNums` that takes two integer parameters and returns the value when the second parameter is subtracted from the first parameter.
    - Uncomment the blah blah test cases in the test/java directory to test this method. Run the
